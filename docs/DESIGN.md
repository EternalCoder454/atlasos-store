# Atlas Store: design

What this file fixes: the layout, the threading rule, what is trusted, who
owns what, and the budgets. Change it together with the code that changes
them. The full plan and its reasons are the Atlas Notes note
"AtlasOS/Store/Plan".

## Scope

The Store replaces KDE Discover on AtlasOS, a bootc image with no PackageKit:
Discover's only backends there are Flatpak and fwupd.

| Discover today | Who covers it |
|---|---|
| Browse, search, app pages (all enabled remotes, Flathub first) | Store |
| Install, remove, update Flatpaks, system and user, with add-ons | Store |
| Sources: remotes, enable, priority, add from `.flatpakrepo` | Store |
| `application/vnd.flatpak.ref`, `.repo`, `vnd.flatpak` bundles | Store |
| `application/x-rpm` | Store explains that RPMs aren't installed on AtlasOS and points to toolbox |
| `appstream:` and `flatpak+https:` links (Kicker, KRunner) | Store |
| Background update checks, automatic updates, notifications | Atlas Updater (unchanged) |
| Firmware (fwupd) | Atlas Updater |
| Launcher and menu entries, `mimeapps.list`, removing Discover | The AtlasOS image |

No ratings or reviews (no ODRS). The only extra network service is the Flathub
API (`flathub.org/api/v2`) for the home page's Popular and Trending, while the
Store is open, cached 24 h.

## Layout

- `crates/atlas-store-core`: no Qt. Launch arguments, AppStream parsing and
  the on-disk index, search, flatpakref and flatpakrepo parsing, AppStream
  markup to blocks, the image fetcher and cache, the Flatpak job queue.
- `apps/atlas-store`: the CXX-Qt backend (`src/backend.rs`), `cpp/main.cpp`
  (Qt start, single instance) and `qml/`.

## Threads

The GUI thread never blocks. Parsing, search, libflatpak calls, downloads and
image decoding run on worker threads and hand results back with
`qt_thread().queue`. One Flatpak job runs at a time; each takes Atlas Updater's
lock (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/atlas-updater-apps.lock`, flock) blocking, on its
worker, and the Store shows "Another update is running" while it waits.

## Single instance

`main.cpp` uses `KDBusService::Unique`. A second launch hands its arguments
and working directory to the first, which raises its window (with the
launcher's activation token) and passes them to `Backend.activate`. The
arguments are parsed in Rust (`atlas_store_core::launch`), never in C++ or
QML:

- `--app <id>`, `--search <text>`, `--page home|installed|updates|sources`
- `--remove <id>`: the app's page with its Remove confirmation open (the
  launcher's Uninstall; it starts `atlas-store --remove <id>` with
  `XDG_ACTIVATION_TOKEN` set). The user still confirms there.
- `appstream://<id>`, `appstream:<id>`, `flatpak+https://...`
- `.flatpakref`, `.flatpakrepo`, `.flatpak` and `.rpm` paths or `file:` URLs

Anything else is refused with a reason, logged, and shown in the window as
plain text. Per launch at most 64 arguments are read, 8 requests acted on and
8 refusals listed. A bare relaunch (the launcher icon) only raises the window.
`org.freedesktop.Application.Open` (any process in the session) is handled
the same way, after a `--`, so nothing it sends is read as an option, and
with no working directory, so relative paths are refused. File paths must be
plain (no `..`, `//`, `/./` or hidden characters). `https` links are checked
by name: a DNS host with a letters-only top level that isn't kept for local
networks, tests or Tor (no IP address, `localhost`, `.local`, `.lan`,
`.internal`, `.home.arpa`, `.onion`...), port 443, no user name, plain ASCII,
no `.` or `..` path segment. International names arrive as `xn--` punycode
and are shown that way. A name can still resolve to a local address, so the
fetcher refuses loopback, private and link-local addresses when it connects
and runs every redirect through the same check. Refusals show a link without
its user name, query or fragment, and an option without its value.

Once requests open dialogs: one launch opens at most one confirmation (the
last request that needs one), a new launch never replaces a dialog the user
is answering, the dialog's default button is never Install, Add or Remove,
and it ignores input for its first half second.

## Trust

Everything from the network or a file is untrusted, and checked where it
enters, in `atlas-store-core`:

- AppStream XML: size cap before parsing, depth and count limits, text
  cleaned of control and bidi characters, length caps, IDs validated.
- AppStream markup becomes blocks of plain text. Nothing is shown as QML
  RichText or HTML. Links open through AtlasPortal, https only.
- Images (screenshots, remote icons): https, an allowlisted host per remote
  (Flathub: `dl.flathub.org`), 15 s timeout, 8 MB cap, redirect cap, magic
  bytes and a pixel cap checked, decoded off the GUI thread, stored in a 200 MB
  LRU disk cache. QML only ever gets `file:` URLs.
- Flathub API JSON: size cap, schema checked, every ID matched against local
  AppStream before it is shown.
- flatpakref and flatpakrepo: read as GLib key files with limits (256 KiB,
  4096 lines, 64 KiB per value), known keys only, translated and unknown keys
  refused, https only, the GPG key parsed and its fingerprint shown,
  `RuntimeRepo=` never followed without its own confirmation. libflatpak
  only ever gets the Store's own `to_bytes()` rewrite, never the file.
- Cache files live under `~/.cache/atlas-store` (0700), written atomically,
  files that are symlinks refused, and the cache folder itself must not be
  one (folders above it may be, for a moved `~/.cache`). A cache folder that is not
  the user's own is not used; one that group or others can write to (Fedora's
  umask 002) is set back to 0700 with a warning.
  The index's checksum catches corruption, not tampering: a process running
  as the user can change any of the user's files, so the reader treats the
  index as untrusted input like the XML. It repeats the parser's per-field
  checks (characters, IDs, URLs, icon files, bundle references, runtimes and
  SDKs, text lengths and whitespace, the bundle matching the component, a
  bundle where one is required, no duplicate IDs), caps sizes and the total
  decoded, and anything wrong means a rebuild. Its caps are the parser's own
  (derived from `Limits` and the constants beside it, so they cannot drift),
  and the parser stops, with an error, when what it keeps would not fit the
  index's file and decode caps. It cannot re-check what only the XML shows
  (such as which of several languages was chosen).
  The header holds the layout `FORMAT` (bumped on any change to `Catalog`,
  `Component` or the encoding) and the `PARSER_REV` (bumped when the parser
  returns something different for the same XML); either one changing means a
  rebuild. A read never changes the cache folder (a group- or other-writable
  one is refused, and the next write sets it to 0700); no file is `Missing`,
  not a fault. After a write only index files last written before it began are
  removed, so a slower writer cannot delete a newer index.

**Confirmation:** nothing is installed, removed or added as a source without
the Store's own dialog, showing the app, the remote, sizes and permissions.
Fedora's polkit gives wheel members Flatpak installs without a password, so
polkit is not the confirmation. System-wide changes go through flatpak's own
polkit helper; the Store has no helper and no polkit actions of its own.

## Lifetime

The Store does nothing when closed: no timer, autostart, D-Bus activation or
notification. AppStream is refreshed only while it is open (when older than
6 h), on a worker, while the cached data is shown.

## Budgets

| What | Budget |
|---|---|
| Cold start to a usable home (cached index) | ≤ 500 ms here, ≤ 1.2 s on the T480 profile |
| First run (index built from 50 MB XML) | ≤ 2 s to home |
| Search, keystroke to results painted | ≤ 50 ms (core query ≤ 5 ms) |
| Scrolling a 3,000-app grid | no frame over 16 ms |
| RSS | ≤ 200 MB on home, ≤ 260 MB after 200 app pages |
| Idle CPU, window open | 0 % |
| Disk | index ≤ 15 MB, screenshots ≤ 200 MB |
| RPM | ≤ 15 MB |
